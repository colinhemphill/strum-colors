## Comparisons

Strum Colors is closely related to both [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) and [Harmony](https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony).

In short, where Harmony is a drop-in replacement for the [Tailwind color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), Strum is a drop-in replacement for Radix UI Colors.
